Luís Filipe Soldado Granadeiro Rosado, born on November 26, 1986, completed a MSc. degree in Electronic Engineering at the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), University of Lisbon (UL) in November 2009 with a final grade of 19 out of 20. His MSc. thesis focused on the domain of sensors, electronic circuits and systems, and algorithms for Eddy Current Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). His thesis work received a grade of 20 out of 20 and was awarded the Professor Luís Vidigal Prize 2008/2009 for the best MSc. thesis in the fields of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Informatics at IST.
He pursued scientific activities leading to a PhD in the same domain he was previously focused, in collaboration with the research units Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT), Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores - Investigação e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID), and Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores - Microsistemas e Nanotecnologias (INESC-MN). He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from IST in December 2014 and was distinguished by the INESC-ID as the best PhD student of 2014 based on the number and quality of his scientific publications.
He is currently an Assistant Professor and responsible for the curricular units of Programmable Electronic Systems, Big-Data Measuring Systems, and Instrumentation and Measurements offered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (DEEC) at IST. He was responsible for creating the Big-Data Measuring Systems curricular unit. He has supervised 25 completed MSc. thesis works and is currently supervising 6 other works. He his currently supervising 2 PhD students, 1 MSc. researcher.
His research interests are mostly related to electromagnetic sensors design, and to mixed signal electronics and signal processing. More specifically, his research has focused on the design of sensors and electronic systems with a holistic approach which resulted in several innovations and achieved specifications that could not be met by those elements individual optimization. This research is answering industrial needs such as the quality control on additive manufacturing processes and emerging societal challenges as the detection/characterization of microplastic particles in water streams. He has participated in 10 R&D projects and supervised 17 scholarships. 
His research efforts have resulted in 26 publications in peer-reviewed journals, 35 publications in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, and 4 patents. His publications have garnered a total of 824 citations and an h-index of 21 according to Google Scholar, and 1162 citations and an h-index of 18 according to the Scopus platform. He has participated in 6 international scientific meetings and 2 organizing committees. He is a regular reviewer for scientific journal papers.
He has professional experience in various business projects and co-founded 4 technology-based companies.
